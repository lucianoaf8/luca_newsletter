# Daily Newsletter Email Template

## Overview

This project is a dynamic, visually appealing daily newsletter email template designed to deliver engaging content to users. The newsletter is driven by a `data.json` file, which allows for easy updates and customization without altering the core HTML structure. The template includes sections for motivational quotes, fun facts, a motivational GIF, top news articles, and weather highlights, all designed to be cohesive, modern, and static for compatibility with various email clients.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content:** All content is pulled from a `data.json` file, making it easy to update and maintain.
- **Modular Design:** The template is divided into separate, reusable components, making it easy to add, remove, or modify sections.
- **Responsive Layout:** While primarily designed for static viewing in emails, the layout is optimized for readability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Static Design:** The template avoids complex interactivity to ensure compatibility across all email clients.
