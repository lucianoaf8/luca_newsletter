### **Technical Documentation: Daily Newsletter Email Project**

---

### **1\. Project Overview**

The daily newsletter email project is designed to deliver dynamic, content-rich newsletters to users, with a focus on modern design, ease of maintenance, and scalability. The project leverages HTML, CSS, JSON, and Python to create a static yet visually engaging email template that is easy to update and extend. The content is dynamically populated from a `data.json` file, ensuring that the newsletter remains relevant and customizable.

### **2\. Tools and Technologies**

- **HTML:** The structure of the email template is built using HTML, with careful consideration given to email client compatibility. The HTML structure follows a modular approach, where each section of the newsletter is divided into separate, reusable components.
- **CSS:** CSS is used to style the newsletter, ensuring that it is visually appealing and consistent across different sections. The CSS is kept relatively simple to maintain compatibility with various email clients, which often have limited support for advanced CSS features.
- **JSON:** The `data.json` file acts as the data source for the newsletter content. All dynamic content, such as text, images, and links, is stored in this JSON file, allowing for easy updates without altering the HTML structure.
- **Python:** The `server.py` script is used for local development and testing. It includes functionality for rendering templates, watching for file changes, and serving the newsletter locally.
- **Jinja2:** This templating engine is used to inject the JSON data into the HTML structure, allowing for dynamic content rendering.
- **Watchdog:** Used in the `server.py` script to watch for file changes and trigger automatic updates.
- **Livereload:** Implemented in the `server.py` script to automatically refresh the browser when changes are detected.
- **Version Control (Git):** Git is used to manage changes to the project, allowing for collaborative development and easy tracking of modifications.

### **3\. Project Structure**

The project is organized into a clear and logical directory structure, ensuring that files are easy to find and manage:

- **Root Directory:**
    - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the newsletter.
    - `data.json`: Stores all the dynamic content for the newsletter.
    - `server.py`: The Python script for local development and testing.
    - `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore.
    - `project-documentation.md`: Contains in-depth documentation about the project design thinking and goals.
    - `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and setup instructions.
    - `technical_documentation.md`: This file, containing technical guidelines and details.
- **CSS Directory (`/css`):**
    - Contains individual CSS files for each section of the newsletter (e.g., `finance_highlights.css`, `footer.css`, `header.css`, etc.).
    - `main.css`: The main stylesheet that may include global styles or be used to consolidate all section-specific styles.
- **Assets Directory (`/assets/imgs`):**
    - Stores all the images and icons used in the newsletter.
- **Sections Directory (`/sections`):**
    - Contains individual HTML files for each section of the newsletter (e.g., `finance_highlights.html`, `footer.html`, `header.html`, etc.).
- **Templates Directory (`/templates`):**
    - `base.html`: The base template file that includes the main structure of the newsletter, with placeholders for sections to be included dynamically.

### **4\. Content Management and Data Binding**

- **Dynamic Content:** The newsletter content is driven by the `data.json` file, which includes all text, images, and links. This file is structured to reflect the different sections of the newsletter, with each section having its own key-value pairs.
- **Data Binding:** The content from `data.json` is bound to the HTML structure using Jinja2 templating. This allows for dynamic rendering of content and easy updates.
- **Content Updates:** To update the content, developers only need to modify the `data.json` file. This approach minimizes the risk of breaking the HTML structure and ensures consistency across updates.

---

### **5\. Local Development and Testing**

The `server.py` script provides a robust local development environment:

- **Template Rendering:** Uses Jinja2 to render the `base.html` template with data from `data.json`.
- **File Watching:** Utilizes Watchdog to monitor changes in HTML, CSS, and JSON files.
- **Auto-Refresh:** Implements Livereload to automatically refresh the browser when changes are detected.
- **Local Serving:** Hosts the newsletter locally for easy testing and development.

To run the local development server:

1. Install the required dependencies (Jinja2, Watchdog, Livereload).
2. Run `python server.py` in the terminal.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

### **6\. Guidelines for Adding New Sections**

When adding new sections to the newsletter, follow these guidelines:

1. **Design Consistency:**
    - Create a new HTML file for the section in the `/sections` directory.
    - Ensure the new section follows the existing visual style and layout principles.
2. **Data Integration:**
    - Extend the `data.json` file to include the new section's content.
    - Use Jinja2 templating syntax in the new section's HTML to bind data from `data.json`.
3. **CSS Styling:**
    - Create a new CSS file for the section in the `/css` directory.
    - Keep styles simple and compatible with email clients.
    - Update `main.css` if necessary for any global style changes.
4. **Template Integration:**
    - Update `base.html` to include the new section using Jinja2's `include` statement.
5. **Testing:**
    - Use the local development server to test the new section's appearance and functionality.
    - Test across multiple email clients to ensure compatibility.
